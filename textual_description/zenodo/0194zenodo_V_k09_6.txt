Title: Storage management

The storage management process begins with reading the order from the automatic order management system. Next, the system checks if the first product from the order is in stock. If the product is available, it is withdrawn from the warehouse. However, if the product is not in stock, a reorder is placed with the wholesaler. Itâ€™s important to note that if the arrival of the product takes more than 10 days, a delivery delay penalty is automatically requested from the wholesaler.

Once the ordered product arrives, it is registered in the stock management system. The next step is to check if the entire order is ready for shipment. If all products are ready, a courier is requested, and the products are packed simultaneously for shipment. If the order is not yet complete, the system selects the next product from the order and begins the process again, starting with checking its stock availability.
