Title: Robotic Burger Seller near the University of Vienna

The robot starts by receiving a customer's order. It then asks whether the customer wants a menu or just a burger. If the customer opts for a menu, the robot begins preparing the drink, which takes a variable amount of time depending on the size selected. While preparing the drink, the robot asks if the customer prefers fries or wedges. If the customer chooses fries, the robot prepares those; if they choose wedges, it prepares those instead, with the duration also varying based on the size of the order. Once the drink and side are ready, or if the customer only ordered a burger, the robot moves on to prepare the burger, with the preparation time depending on the number of ingredients chosen. Throughout the process, the robot provides enthusiastic status updates every 30 seconds to keep the customer informed. Finally, the completed order is delivered to the customer via a conveyor belt.
