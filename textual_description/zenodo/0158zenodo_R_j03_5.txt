Title: Service for Your Fridge

Your fridge is making unusual noises. To address the issue, you describe the symptoms and send this information, along with the fridge model, to the central service center. They will then select a local service facility, each of which has its own procedures for interacting with customers.

The chosen service facility will schedule an appointment and arrive at an unspecified time. Occasionally, they may need to leave without completing the repair if additional parts are required.

Once your fridge is repaired, you'll need to confirm that it is functioning properly again. Afterward, you can provide a rating for the service facility based on your experience.
