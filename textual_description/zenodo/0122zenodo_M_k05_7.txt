Title: Building a House

You’re planning to build a treehouse. Begin by gathering your requirements and sending them to a treehouse architect. The architect will return a draft that you can refine several times by adding more details. Once you’ve finalized the design, compile a list of the necessary materials based on the plan. These materials will be categorized, and you can order them from multiple online retailers. While waiting for your orders to be processed, reach out to friends to enlist their help with the construction. After the treehouse is built, send out invitations for a party to celebrate. Finally, create a list of attendees to help you buy snacks for the gathering.
