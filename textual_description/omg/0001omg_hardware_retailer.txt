The shipment process of a hardware retailer begins when goods are ready to be shipped. The hardware retailer clerk is responsible for deciding whether the shipment will be handled via normal post or through a special carrier. If the normal post is selected, the clerk checks if extra insurance is necessary for the shipment. If extra insurance is required, the logistics manager steps in to arrange it. Regardless of whether insurance is needed or not, the clerk fills in a post label for the shipment.

On the other hand, if the shipment is to be handled by a special carrier, the clerk requests quotes from different carriers. Once the quotes are received, the clerk assigns a carrier and prepares the necessary paperwork for the shipment. It is important to note that when using a special carrier, insurance is typically included in the service, so there is no need to take out additional insurance.

While the clerical work is being handled, a warehouse worker packages the goods to prepare them for shipment. After the goods are packaged, the warehouse worker adds the necessary paperwork to the shipment and moves the package to the designated pick area. At this point, the goods are available for pick-up, completing the shipment process.
