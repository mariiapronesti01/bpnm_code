Self-Service Restaurant

When a guest enters the restaurant feeling hungry, they select a dish from the rotating menu and wait for their turn. Once called, the guest places their order with the staff member, who inputs it into the POS system and collects payment. After the transaction, the employee activates a buzzer and hands it to the guest, explaining, “Your meal will be ready when the buzzer rings.” The employee then notifies the chef about the new order. The chef prepares the dish and places it in the service hatch, informing the employee once the meal is ready. When the employee sees that the meal is finished, they activate the guest’s buzzer, signaling that the meal is ready for pickup. The guest can then collect their meal and enjoy it. If the guest does not respond to the buzzer within five minutes, the employee will call for them, repeating this as necessary.
