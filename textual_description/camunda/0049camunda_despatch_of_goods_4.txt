TITLE: Goods Dispatch
If goods are to be shipped, the secretary confirms who will handle the shipping. For large quantities, special shipping arrangements are required. In such cases, the secretary invites three logistics companies to submit bids and chooses one. For small quantities, regular postal service is used. The secretary prepares a shipping label, and the logistics department head arranges parcel insurance if needed.
Meanwhile, the warehouse staff can start packaging the goods. Once everything is ready, the packaged items are prepared for collection by the selected logistics company.
