TITLE: Dispatch of Goods

When goods are to be shipped, the secretary determines the shipping arrangements. For larger shipments, special logistics are required. In such cases, the secretary invites three logistics companies to submit bids and selects one to handle the shipping. For smaller shipments, standard postal services are utilized. The secretary prepares a shipping label, and if necessary, the logistics department head secures parcel insurance.

Meanwhile, warehouse staff can begin packaging the goods. Once everything is ready, the packaged items are organized for pickup by the selected logistics company.


This process takes place at a small hardware company that ships both small orders directly to end customers and larger orders to retail stores.
