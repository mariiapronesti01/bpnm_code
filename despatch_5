TITLE: Goods Shipping Procedure

The secretary is responsible for arranging all shipments. For larger quantities, special logistics are required, and she requests quotes from three logistics companies before selecting one. For smaller shipments, standard postal services are sufficient. The secretary also handles the creation of shipping labels, and if needed, the logistics department head arranges insurance for the package.

While the shipping arrangements are being finalized, the warehouse staff can begin packing the goods. Once packed and ready, the goods are prepared for collection by the selected logistics company.

Background Information:
This procedure is carried out by a small hardware company, which ships both small parcels to individual customers and larger shipments to other businesses.
