TITLE: Recourse

Background Information:
Insured individuals may be obligated to repay funds received from their insurance company for various reasons, a process known as recourse. The clerk outlines the procedure involved.

When a potential subrogation against an insured person is identified, the clerk collects relevant information. If subrogation is possible, the clerk issues a payment request to the insured and sets a reminder. If recourse is not an option, the clerk closes the case.

Once payment is received, the clerk records the transaction and finalizes the case. If the insured disputes the recourse, the clerk evaluates the reasoning. If the dispute is valid, the case is closed; if not, it is referred to a collection agency. If the dispute deadline passes without payment, the clerk also forwards the case to the collection agency.
