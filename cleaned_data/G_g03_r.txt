Title: Blizzard Online Character Generator

Blizzard has developed a fantastic online tool for creating characters for their latest WoW expansion. When setting up a World of Warcraft character, you can do two things at once: while establishing your account, you can brainstorm some great character names. The account setup begins by verifying whether you already have a Battle.net account. If you don’t have one, you’ll need to enter your account information and click the link provided in the confirmation email. Once your Battle.net account is active, you can check if you have a current WoW subscription. If you don’t, you’ll need to choose a payment method. If you opt for a credit card, you’ll enter your card details; if you prefer a bank transfer, you’ll need to provide your IBAN and BIC numbers. After that, you can log in to the game and select your character's realm, race, and class. By this point, you should have thought of some suitable names. You can enter them one by one until you find one that is still available. Once you successfully create a name, you’ll receive a confirmation along with some character selfies. When the expansion is released, you'll get another notification.
