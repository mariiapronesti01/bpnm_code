TITLE: Dispatch of Goods

When it comes to shipping goods, the secretary oversees the logistics arrangements. For larger shipments, specialized shipping solutions are necessary. In these cases, the secretary solicits bids from three logistics companies and selects one to handle the shipping. For smaller orders, standard postal services are employed. The secretary prepares the shipping label, and if needed, the logistics department head arranges for parcel insurance.

Meanwhile, warehouse personnel can start packing the items. Once everything is prepared, the packaged goods are set for pickup by the selected logistics provider.

Background Information:
This process is carried out at a small hardware company that delivers small orders to individual customers and larger quantities to retail partners.
