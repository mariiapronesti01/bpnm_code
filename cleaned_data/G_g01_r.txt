Name: LAN Party

You’re planning a LAN party for 10 friends, and your first task is to send them invitations. After that, you’ll need to check which games they’re interested in playing. Once you have the game preferences, you can schedule a date for the party. If at least 8 people confirm their availability for that date, you’re set to go. If not, you’ll have to select another date until 8 friends can join. While you’re coordinating the date, make sure you have all the games on your guests’ lists; download any that are missing. Next, determine how much beer your friends will need, and purchase any additional supplies if required. After you’ve sorted everything out, you can look forward to enjoying the LAN party!
